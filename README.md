This code is basically used to calculate net electricity consumption for different apartments over a span of 4 years ie (2017,2018,2019,2021)
and further finds the degree days based on the daily temperature data which i obtained from 'https://power.larc.nasa.gov/data-access-viewer/'
website and also plots box plots of net electricty consumption for each year and its variation with degree days.
